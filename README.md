# AI tool for trash detection 
<h4>Introduction</h4>

SpotGarbage it's an AI algorithm for detecting trash in geolocated images.
<br>
It needs to be stated that trash-detection is forked from the implementation of <a href="https://github.com/letsdoitworld/wade-ai">KristiinaKerge</a>

<h4>Approach</h4>
The solution was build using Mask R-CNN and trained on dataset consisting of almost 1400 crowd sourced images containing trash. Ideally we would end up with a computer vision algorithm that could detect trash from any picture or video that has a geotag attached to it.

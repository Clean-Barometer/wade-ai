# AI tool for trash detection 

Let's Do It Foundation (LDIF) is working on building an AI solutio n capable of detecting trash in images and videos. Video of the project is here https://youtu.be/zsgpqsRRzTE
 
## Approach
The solution was build using Mask R-CNN and trained on dataset consisting of almost 1400 crowd sourced images containing trash. Ideally we would end up with a computer vision algorithm that could detect trash from any picture or video that has a geotag attached to it.
